# Configure Tab capability within your Teams app

## Introduction

Tabs are Teams-aware webpages embedded in Microsoft Teams. They're simple HTML <iframe\> tags that point to domains declared in the app manifest and can be added as part of a channel inside a team, group chat, or personal app for an individual user. You can include custom tabs with your app to embed your own web content in Teams or add Teams-specific functionality to your web content. Learn more from [Build tabs for Teams
](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/tabs/what-are-tabs).

## Prerequisites

Before configuring a tab as an additional capability, please ensure that:

- You have a Teams application and its manifest.
- You have a Microsoft 365 account to test the application.

Prior to continuing, we strongly recommend creating and going through a Tab app with Teams Toolkit.
To create a Tab app with Teams Toolkit, please visit [Tab app with Teams Toolkit](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/create-new-project?pivots=visual-studio-code)

The following steps outline how to configure the Tab capability:

1. [Configure Tab capability in Teams application manifest](#configure-tab-capability-in-teams-application-manifest).
1. [Setup local debug environment](#setup-local-debug-environment).
1. [Move the application to Azure](#move-the-application-to-azure).

For a complete example, please refer to [Hello World Bot with Tab](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx-Samples/tree/v3/hello-world-bot-with-tab).

## Configure Tab capability in Teams application manifest

1. To configure your tab within a group or channel, or personal scope in your Teams application manifest `appPackage/manifest.json`, follow these examples:
    Examples:
    ```
      "staticTabs": [
          {
              "entityId": "index",
              "name": "Personal Tab",
              "contentUrl": "${{TAB_ENDPOINT}}/index.html#/tab",
              "websiteUrl": "${{TAB_ENDPOINT}}/index.html#/tab",
              "scopes": [
                  "personal"
              ]
          }
      ],
    ```
    ```
      "configurableTabs": [
          {
              "configurationUrl": "${{TAB_ENDPOINT}}/index.html#/config",
              "canUpdateConfiguration": true,
              "scopes": [
                  "team",
                  "groupchat"
              ]
          }
      ],
    ```

1. Add your tab domain to the `validDomains` field.
    Example:
    ```
    "validDomains": [
        "${{TAB_DOMAIN}}"
    ],
    ```
    `TAB_ENDPOINT` and `TAB_DOMAIN` are built-in variables of Teams Toolkit. They will be replaced with the true endpoint in runtime based on your current environment(local, dev, etc.).

## Setup local debug environment in VSCode

If you prefer to create a server-side tab app, you may not need to update your folder structure or debug profile. Simply add new routes to the tab page in your bot service.
However, this document assumes that you are adding a client-side tab app.

1. To begin, bring your tab app code into your project. If you do not have one, you can create a new Tab app project with Teams Toolkit and copy the source code to into your current project.
For example, your folder structure look like:
    ```
    .
    |-- appPackage/
    |-- env/
    |-- infra/
    |-- tabs/           <!--tab app source code-->
    |   |-- src/
    |   |   |-- index.tsx
    |   |-- package.json
    |-- src/            <!--your current source code-->
    |   |-- index.ts
    |-- package.json
    |-- teamsapp.yml
    ```

    We recommend to re-organizing the folder structure as follows:

    ```
    .
    |-- appPackage/
    |-- infra/
    |-- tabs/           <!--tab app source code-->
    |   |-- src/
    |   |   |-- index.tsx
    |   |-- package.json
    |-- bot/            <!--move your current source code to a new sub folder-->
    |   |-- src/
    |   |   |-- index.ts
    |   |-- package.json
    |-- teamsapp.yml
    ```

1. To configure the debug profile for your new tab project, add the following section to your `tasks.json`. You can find a complete example [here](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx-Samples/tree/dev/hello-world-bot-with-tab/.vscode).

    ```json
    {
        "label": "Start application",
        "dependsOn": [
            "Start bot",
            "Start frontend"
        ]
    },
    {
        "label": "Start bot",
        "type": "shell",
        "command": "npm run dev:teamsfx",
        "isBackground": true,
        "options": {
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/bot"
        },
        "problemMatcher": {
            "pattern": [
                {
                    "regexp": "^.*$",
                    "file": 0,
                    "location": 1,
                    "message": 2
                }
            ],
            "background": {
                "activeOnStart": true,
                "beginsPattern": "[nodemon] starting",
                "endsPattern": "restify listening to|Bot/ME service listening at|[nodemon] app crashed"
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "label": "Start frontend",
        "type": "shell",
        "command": "npm run dev:teamsfx",
        "isBackground": true,
        "options": {
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/tab"
        },
        "problemMatcher": {
            "pattern": {
                "regexp": "^.*$",
                "file": 0,
                "location": 1,
                "message": 2
            },
            "background": {
                "activeOnStart": true,
                "beginsPattern": ".*",
                "endsPattern": "Compiled|Failed|compiled|failed"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Update the `teamsapp.local.yml` file and add new actions. These actions will enable your tab project to work seamlessly with Teams Toolkit.

    ```yaml
    provision:
      - uses: script # Set TAB_DOMAIN for local launch
        name: Set TAB_DOMAIN for local launch
        with:
          run: echo "::set-output TAB_DOMAIN=localhost:53000"
      - uses: script # Set TAB_ENDPOINT for local launch
        name: Set TAB_ENDPOINT for local launch
        with:
          run: echo "::set-output TAB_ENDPOINT=https://localhost:53000"
    deploy:
      - uses: prerequisite/install # Install dependencies
        with:
          devCert:
            trust: true
        writeToEnvironmentFile: # Write the information of installed dependencies into environment file for the specified environment variable(s).
          sslCertFile: SSL_CRT_FILE
          sslKeyFile: SSL_KEY_FILE

      - uses: cli/runNpmCommand # Run npm command
        with:
          args: install --no-audit
          workingDirectory: ./tab

      - uses: file/createOrUpdateEnvironmentFile # Generate runtime environment variables for tab
        with:
          target: ./tab/.localSettings
          envs:
            BROWSER: none
            HTTPS: true
            PORT: 53000
            SSL_CRT_FILE: ${{SSL_CRT_FILE}}
            SSL_KEY_FILE: ${{SSL_KEY_FILE}}
    ```

1. Once you have configured your project and updated the necessary files, you can try local debugging with Visual Studio Code. This will allow you to test and troubleshoot your tab app before deploying it to Teams.

## Move the application to Azure

If you prefer to create a server-side tab app, you may not need to update your bicep files or Azure infrastructure. Your tab app can be hosted in the same Azure App Service as your bot.
However, this document assumes that you are adding a client-side tab app.

1. Add the following snippet to your bicep file to provision an Azure Storage Account for your tab app.

    ```bicep
    @maxLength(20)
    @minLength(4)
    param resourceBaseName string
    param storageSku string
    param storageName string = resourceBaseName
    param location string = resourceGroup().location

    // Azure Storage that hosts your static web site
    resource storage 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2021-06-01' = {
      kind: 'StorageV2'
      location: location
      name: storageName
      properties: {
        supportsHttpsTrafficOnly: true
      }
      sku: {
        name: storageSku
      }
    }

    output TAB_AZURE_STORAGE_RESOURCE_ID string = storage.id // used in deploy stage
    output TAB_DOMAIN string = siteDomain
    output TAB_ENDPOINT string = 'https://${siteDomain}'
    ```

1. Additionally, make sure to update the `azure.parameters.json` file to ensure that necessary parameters are set correctly.

    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentParameters.json#",
      "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
      "parameters": {
        "resourceBaseName": {
          "value": "helloworld${{RESOURCE_SUFFIX}}"
        },
        "storageSku": {
          "value": "Standard_LRS"
        },
        ...
      }
    }
    ```

1. To host your tab app in Azure Storage, you'll need to enable the static website feature for the storage account. Add the following action in your `teamsapp.yml` file.

    ```yml
    provision:
      - uses: azureStorage/enableStaticWebsite
        with:
          storageResourceId: ${{TAB_AZURE_STORAGE_RESOURCE_ID}}
          indexPage: index.html
          errorPage: error.html
    ```

1. Run `Teams: Provision in the cloud` command in Visual Studio Code to apply the bicep to Azure.

1. To automate the build and deployment of your tab app, add the following build and deploy action to your `teamsapp.yml` file.

    ```
      - uses: cli/runNpmCommand # Run npm command
        with:
          args: install
      - uses: cli/runNpmCommand # Run npm command
        with:
          args: run build
      # Deploy bits to Azure Storage Static Website
      - uses: azureStorage/deploy
        with:
          workingDirectory: tab
          # Deploy base folder
          artifactFolder: build
          # The resource id of the cloud resource to be deployed to. This key will be generated by arm/deploy action automatically. You can replace it with your existing Azure Resource id or add it to your environment variable file.
          resourceId: ${{TAB_AZURE_STORAGE_RESOURCE_ID}}
    ```

1. Run `Teams: Deploy to cloud` command in Visual Studio Code to deploy your Tab app code to Azure.

1. Open the `Run and Debug Activity Panel` and select `Launch Remote (Edge)` or `Launch Remote (Chrome)`. Press F5 to preview your Teams app.
